# Simple 1D Particle in Cell
Particle in cell simulation with poisson solver written in [rust][rust-lang]. The mesh is computed with second-order centered finite difference, force interpolation is computed with Cloud in Cell, time integrator is computed with leapfrog (Stormer-Verlet) method. 

## TODO:
- [ ] - Implement Accleration Function
- [ ] - Implement L2Norm Function
- [ ] - Implement Poisson Function
- [ ] - Implement Evolution 
- [ ] - Implement writing to file
